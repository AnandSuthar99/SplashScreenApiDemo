# Android 12 Splash Screen API Demo #

## Overview
This is a demo repository showcasing the implementation of the Splash Screen API introduced in Android 12. The Splash Screen API allows developers to create a more seamless and engaging launch experience for their Android apps.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/AnandSuthar99/SplashScreenApiDemo.git
```

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Ensure you have an Android 12 device or emulator with API level 31 for testing the Splash Screen API.

## Splash Screen API
The Splash Screen API provides a standardized way to manage your app's splash screen. It allows you to set a custom splash screen content view, control the duration of the splash screen, and handle any background work during the splash screen display.

This demo app demonstrates the following aspects of the Splash Screen API:

1. Creating a custom splash screen layout with branding elements.
2. Defining a theme for the splash screen using the R.style.Theme_App_Starting.
3. Implementing a splash screen using the SplashScreen API from androidx.core.splashscreen.

## Usage
1. The demo app is already set up to use the Splash Screen API. You can find the implementation in the MainActivity.kt file.
2. Use your own animated vector drawable or app icon and customize themes.xml file.

We hope this demo helps you explore and understand the new Splash Screen API in Android 12. Happy coding! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out or refer to the [Official Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen) for more information.
